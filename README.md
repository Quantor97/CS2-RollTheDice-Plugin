## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

After the initialization of the plugin, two files and a folder are created. Firstly, the Config.json file is generated, which holds the plugin settings. Secondly, the en.json file is created along with the 'translation' folder. The Config.json is intended for adjusting effects and general settings, while en.json is used for translation.
In config.json, all effects provided by the plugin are listed in the "effects" section, and there is a "general" section providing general settings for the plugin.

To switch the plugin's language, modify the 'language' attribute in the config.json and then either manually create or let the plugin generate a file in the 'translations' folder with the identical name specified in the 'config' file. Translate your content within that file. For guidance, you can refer to the default en.json. I suggest using ChatGPT for translation to prevent formatting issues

A description for the **general** section in config.json:
- **Language**: Determines the language for all translations.
- **DiceRollsPerRound**: Specifies the number of dice rolls allowed per round for each player.
- **BroadcastDiceRoll**: If true, everyone on the server can witness the outcome.
- **BroadcastDiceRollTerroristOnly**: If true, only Terrorists can see the dice rolls of other players.
- **BroadcastDiceRollCounterTerroristOnly**: If true, only Counter-Terrorists can see the dice rolls of other players.
- **BroadcastPluginCommand**: If true, a plugin command info is broadcasted at the beginning of each round.
- **UnicastDiceRoll**: If true, the LocalPlayer can see their own dice rolls.
- **UnicastEffectDescription**: If true, the effect description is displayed for the LocalPlayer.
- **UnicastRollAmount**: If true, the number of rolls available to the player is shown.
- **TsCanRoll**: Determines whether Terrorists are allowed to roll the dice.
- **CTsCanRoll**: Determines whether Counter-Terrorists are allowed to roll the dice.
- **ResetRollsOnRoundStart**: If true, all rolls and effects are reset at the start of each round.
- **ResetRollsOnDeath**: If true, rolls and effects are reset for a player upon death.

To manipulate the effects, the config.json displays three attributes for each effect: "Enabled," "Probability," and "Parameters."

- **Enabled**: This attribute, as the name suggests, toggles the effect on or off.
- **Probability**: This is the entry factor for the effect. It's not a direct probability but a factor determining the occurrence of the effect. Please note that this is not a probability in the traditional sense; it's a factor that influences the likelihood of the effect happening. Don't be surprised; I designed it this way to avoid having to adjust probabilities every time you tweak a value.
- **Parameters**: These are arguments specific to each effect. All values must be specified as strings; otherwise, it won't work. Refer to the standard parameters in the config file for guidance.

## üîó Dependencies

To ensure the CS2-RollTheDice-Plugin works correctly, you'll need to have the following dependencies installed on your server:

- **Metamod for CS2**: An essential mod that allows for the use of plugins on your server. Download it from [Metamod:Source](https://www.sourcemm.net/downloads.php/?branch=master).

- **CounterStrikeSharp (Version 30 or higher)**: A library necessary for the plugin's functionality. Ensure you have at least version 30. Get it from [CounterStrikeSharp on GitHub](https://github.com/roflmuffin/CounterStrikeSharp).

Please follow the installation instructions provided on their respective websites to install these dependencies correctly before attempting to install the CS2-RollTheDice-Plugin.

## üöÄ Installation

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/Quantor97/CS2-RollTheDice-Plugin/releases)
2. Make sure you have CounterStrikeSharp and Metamod installed
3. Place the addons folder into your server's CounterStrikeSharp plugin directory.
4. Restart your server to see the plugin in action.

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap
- **Convars**: Convert the general settings into convars.
- **Localization Enhancement**: Automatically detect the player's region and select the appropriate translation, if available.
- **Effect Implementation**: Introduce the remaining planned effects and possibly add new ones.
