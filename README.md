## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

After the initialization of the plugin, several .json files (a total of 3) are created in the Config directory within the CounterStrikeSharp folder (Config directory: \addons\counterstrikesharp\configs\plugins\RollTheDice). Firstly, there is the **RollTheDice.json** file, which provides general settings for the plugin. Additionally, in the 'effects' folder, there is a **default.json** file where you can edit the values of the effects. Finally, there is the **en.json** file in the 'Translations' folder, where you can set your own language file. You can create your own effects and translation files by simply creating a new JSON file. For example, if you want to translate into Spanish, create a new JSON file in the Translations folder and adjust the translation values (it's best to copy everything from en.json and modify the values in your file). Same for effects.

To switch the plugin's language, modify the 'language' attribute in the RollTheDice.json and then either manually create or let the plugin generate a file in the 'translations' folder with the identical name specified in the 'config' file. Translate your content within that file. For guidance, you can refer to the default en.json. I suggest using ChatGPT for translation to prevent formatting issues

A description for the **RollTheDice.json** config file:
- **Language**: Determines the language for the plugin (A new JSON file will be generated if one with the specified name does not exist).
- **Effect config file**: Determines the configuration for the effects (A new JSON file will be generated if one with the specified name does not exist)
- **Rolls per Round**: Specifies the number of dice rolls allowed per round for each player.
- **Remove last effect on roll**: Deletes the last effect as soon as a new effect is added (WIP).
- **Ts can roll**: Determines whether Terrorists are allowed to roll the dice.
- **CTs can roll**: Determines whether Counter-Terrorists are allowed to roll the dice.
- **Print roll message for all teams**: If true, everyone on the server can witness the outcome.
- **Print roll message for Ts**: If true, Terrorists can see the dice rolls of other players.
- **Print roll message for CTs**: If true, Counter-Terrorists can see the dice rolls of other players.
- **Print plugin command information**: If true, a plugin command info is broadcasted at the beginning of each round.
- **Print roll message for LocalPlayer**: If true, the LocalPlayer can see their own dice rolls.
- **Print effect description for LocalPlayer**: If true, the effect description is displayed for the LocalPlayer.
- **Print roll amount for LocalPlayer**: If true, the number of rolls available to the player is shown.
- **Reset effects and roll count for all players at round start**: If true, all rolls and effects are reset at the start of each round.
- **Reset effects and roll for LocalPlayer at death**: If true, rolls and effects are reset for a player upon death.

To manipulate the effects, the **default.json** in effects folder displays three attributes for each effect: "Enabled," "Probability," and "Parameters."

- **Enabled**: This attribute, as the name suggests, toggles the effect on or off.
- **Probability**: This is the entry factor for the effect. It's not a direct probability but a factor determining the occurrence of the effect. Please note that this is not a probability in the traditional sense; it's a factor that influences the likelihood of the effect happening. Don't be surprised; I designed it this way to avoid having to adjust probabilities every time you tweak a value.
- **Parameters**: These are arguments specific to each effect. All values must be specified as strings; otherwise, it won't work. Refer to the standard parameters in the config file for guidance.

## üîó Dependencies

To ensure the CS2-RollTheDice-Plugin works correctly, you'll need to have the following dependencies installed on your server:

- **Metamod for CS2**: An essential mod that allows for the use of plugins on your server. Download it from [Metamod:Source](https://www.sourcemm.net/downloads.php/?branch=master).

- **CounterStrikeSharp (Version 30 or higher)**: A library necessary for the plugin's functionality. Ensure you have at least version 30. Get it from [CounterStrikeSharp on GitHub](https://github.com/roflmuffin/CounterStrikeSharp).

Please follow the installation instructions provided on their respective websites to install these dependencies correctly before attempting to install the CS2-RollTheDice-Plugin.

## üöÄ Installation

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/Quantor97/CS2-RollTheDice-Plugin/releases)
2. Make sure you have CounterStrikeSharp and Metamod installed
3. Place the addons folder into your server's CounterStrikeSharp plugin directory.
4. Restart your server to see the plugin in action.

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap
- **Convars**: Convert the general settings into convars.
- **Localization Enhancement**: Automatically detect the player's region and select the appropriate translation, if available.
- **Effect Implementation**: Introduce the remaining planned effects and possibly add new ones.
